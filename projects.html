<h1>projects</h1>
<P>Although i have only just started i do have a  couple of projects under my belt currently and this will swiftly keep expanding.</P>
<p>the first project i worked on was a solo project assigned on my coding course.</p>
<br>
<div class="project_1">
<h3>coffee shop website</h3>
<img src="images/cofair.png" alt="cofair site" style="width: 600px;height: 300px">
<p>this was a relatively simple project however there was a few errors.</p>
<p>i did not manage to figure out responsiveness at this point and in order to try to sort this issue out</p>
<p>i ended up breaking the site completely on mobile devices.</p>
<p>however i did do some thing that was good.</p>
<p>for example i figured out how to link a website and i made a little easter egg</p>
<p>when anybody hits the twitter or other social media links at the footer page</p>
<p>it links to starbucks social media as this coffee shop was not real and had no social media.</p>
<p>as well as that i set the background to a image that was dmca free as it was available for comercial use.</p>
<p>made with css and html as per our restrictions this was my first taste of coding.</p>
<p>here is the githb link to check it out.</p>

<div class="project_2">
<h3>team based text-based game</h3>
<p>for this project we worked as a team. we only had 3 days to make this so it was very quick.</p>
<p>although there is bugs such as not everything fully loops it was still a fun experience.</p>
<p>we have some level of looping going on as well as one team member made some askii art.</p>
<p>as well as that we had multiple endings and even made use of lists.</p>
<p>a simple project with a lot of depth for such a short time and with python only restriction.</p>
<p>it showed great teamwork to work so efficiently together. check it out on my github below.</p>

<div class="project_3">
<h3>to-do app</h3>
<img src="images/to-do app.png" alt="to-do app" style="width: 600px; height: 300px;">
<p>made with css, javascript and html i took on this personal challenge to improve my skills even more.</p>
<p>although with this there is only 1 issue tha tbeing with text typed remaining on enter</p>
<p>my skills improved drastically with this short project and im very proud of the results.</p>
<p>using javascripts built in storage system this app saves peoples todo's on reload.</p>
<p>as well as that users can cross out or delete any to-do's that are done or have a error in the typing.</p>
<p>i learned responsiveness, something ive carried on to this portfolio site.</p>
<p>although simple as a project these increase my knowledge in a efficient and practical way.</p>
<p>if interested check it out below.</p>
