    <h1>projects</h1> 
    <P>Although I have only just started, I do have a couple of projects under my belt currently and this will swiftly keep expanding. </P> 
    <p>the first project I worked on was a solo project assigned on my coding course. </p> 
    <br> 
    <div class="project_1"> 
    <h3>coffee shop website</h3> 
    <img src="images/cofair.png" alt="cofair site"> 
    <p>this was a relatively simple project however there was a few errors. </p> 
    <p>I did not manage to figure out responsiveness at this point and to try to sort this issue out</p> 
    <p>I ended up breaking the site completely on mobile devices. </p> 
    <p>however I did do something that was good. </p> 
    <p>for example I figured out how to link a website and I made a little easter egg</p> 
    <p>when anybody hits the twitter or other social media links at the footer page</p> 
    <p>it links to Starbucks social media as this coffee shop was not real and had no social media. </p> 
    <p>as well as that I set the background to an image that was DMCA free as it was available for commercial use. </p> 
    <p>made with CSS and html as per our restrictions this was my first taste of coding. </p> 
    <p>here is the githb link to check it out. </p>

    <div class="project_2"> 
    <h3>team-based text-based game</h3> 
    <p>for this project we worked as a team. we only had 3 days to make this, so it was very quick. </p> 
    <p>although there are bugs such as not everything fully loops it was still a fun experience. </p> 
    <p>we have some level of looping going on as well as one team member made some askii art.</p> 
    <p>as well as that we had multiple endings and even made use of lists. </p> 
    <p>a simple project with a lot of depth for such a short time and with python only restriction. </p> 
    <p>it showed great teamwork to work so efficiently together. check it out on my github below. </p>

    <div class="project_3"> 
    <h3>to-do app</h3> 
    <img src="images/to-do app.png" alt="to-do app"> 
    <p>made with CSS, JavaScript and html I took on this personal challenge to improve my skills even more. </p> 
    <p>although with this there is only 1 issue that being with text typed remaining on enter</p> 
    <p>my skills improved drastically with this short project and I'm very proud of the results. </p> 
    <p>using JavaScript's built in storage system this app saves peoples to-do's on reload. </p> 
    <p>as well as that users can cross out or delete any to-do's that are done or have an error in the typing. </p> 
    <p>I learned responsiveness, something I've carried on to this portfolio site. </p> 
    <p>although simple as a project these increase my knowledge in a efficient and practical way. </p> 
    <p>if interested check it out below. </p>
