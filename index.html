<h1>serene's portfolio</h1>
<div class = about>
<p>Hello there and welcome to my website.</p> 
<p>My name is rhys or online serenegeneration.</p>
<p>I may not have as much experience as other people you may find in your interview progress</p>
<p>but what I lack in the experience currently I excel in my capability to learn at a swift pace.</p>
<p>Essentially I believe due to ADHD and complete aphantasia my brain functions in a unique way.</p>
<p>All information stores itself in my subconscious near instantly and is able to come out</p>
<p>whenever it is needed.</p>
<p>This is something that just happens without me even knowing half the time and I believe it is</p>
<p>a result of the adhd and complete aphantasia forming a symbiotic relationship with each other.</p>
<P>On top of that I have the ability to get along with everybody due to my personality.</P>
<p>i'm genuine, kind, friendly and I honestly care about people.</p>
<p>So why not give me a try. You won't regret your decision.</p>
<p>Thank you and I hope you have a amazing day.</p>
