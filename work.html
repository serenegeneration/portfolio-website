<p>unfotunately i have yet to get a job in this industry yet. however im sure that can change!</p>
<p>i do however, have work experience.</p>
<p>i have spent the past 4 years from november 2020 - november 2024 working as a home shopper at asda.</p>
<p>this gave me 4 years of working as a team of around 15 in a fast working enviroment.</p>
<p>during this time i built up huge confidence in myself and worked very hard to get my job done.</p>
<p>as well as that my team building skills drastically increased too and i became</p>
<p>very comfortable doing so during that time.</p>
