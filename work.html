    <p>Unfortunately I have yet to get a job in this industry yet. However, I'm sure that can change! </p> 
    <p>I do, however, have work experience. </p> 
    <p>I have spent the past 4 years from November 2020 - November 2024 working as a home shopper at Asda. </p> 
    <p>this gave me 4 years of working as a team of around 15 in a fast-working environment. </p> 
    <p>during this time I built up huge confidence in myself and worked very hard to get my job done. </p> 
    <p>as well as that my team building skills drastically increased too and I became</p> 
    <p>very comfortable doing so during that time. <p>
